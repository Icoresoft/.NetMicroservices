    /**
    * Add Docker  compose
    * ====================
    * Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
    * With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services.
    * Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
    *
    * 1- right click on your project => add => container orchestration suport
    * 2- it will add dockerfile to your project to build image for your project
    * 3- it will also create new project docker-compose and make it as a startup project
    * 4- docker-compose.yml file will initially contains your project image that
    *    you use when adding container orchestraion support
    * 5- you can edit docker-compose.yml in docker-compose project to add more images
    *    to the compose (images you need to run your application
    *    Example Catalog.API image  + MongoDb image
    * Notes:
    * ======
    * you can edit your application port number that docker expose it from
    * dockerfile=>expose ContainerPortNo command
    * you can add more environment to docker-compose by adding more files to docker-compose-yml
    * for example docker-compose.override.yml OR  docker-compose.dev.yml etc
